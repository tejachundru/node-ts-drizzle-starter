# API Endpoints Overview

This document outlines the API endpoints structure without detailing each individual route.

## Structure

- You need to add endpoints explicitly to the `src/app/routes/index.ts` file.

- All routes are picked from controllers in the `src/app/controllers` directory by scanning the directory recursively.
